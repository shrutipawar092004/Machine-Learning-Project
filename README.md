# Machine-Learning-Project

This repository contains a Machine Learning project implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview
The notebook demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including data loading, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and model evaluation.

Various machine learning techniques are applied to train and test the model. Performance metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the model and analyze its accuracy and reliability.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. Data Import and Understanding  
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Model Training  
5. Model Evaluation and Performance Analysis  


## Objective
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning concepts to real-world data and gain insights through predictive modeling.
